# The Lab

Welcome to my `lab/`!

The `lab/` is my safe place to learn, explore and build, it's divided into `experiments`, `projects` and `deliverables`.

## Experiments

Are exercises from different sources toward a common topic, by their nature they can be unestable and messy and it's OK.

## Projects

Are small demos, they shouldn't be practical but a proof consolidated of knowledge.

## Deliverables

Are real world applications covering real needs.
